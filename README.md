# personalWebsite
This is Ryan Mortimer's first github project.
This is Ryan Mortimer's first try at a website built entirely from scratch. It is based on the website - http://www.garysheng.com/ After the base structure is built up, jQuery will be added to extend on the website as an excercise. After that it should be extended as a show case for other frameworks for learning, as well as links to other pieces of work (ie Docker,AWS,Bluemix,etc)
